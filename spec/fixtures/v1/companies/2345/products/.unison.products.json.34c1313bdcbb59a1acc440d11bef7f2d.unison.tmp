    "description": "That's how they spell it in Corsica. Pale-hued, with a lightly peppery aroma, hints of talc, fresh herbs and other, more savoury notes. Delicate in the mouth; light-bodied and dry, lean and savoury, not fruity. Fairly simple but well made: it's an adaptable food wine.",

    "description": "The flavour is voluminous and gorgeously smooth, with a pillowy roundness, yet it's not even remotely fat, oily or lacking acidity. A great viognier, as good as any from France.",

    "description": "Condrieu is the appellation and this one is classy. Very complex, with honeysuckle, spice and stone-fruit aromas. Fragrant, rich, full-bodied and dense, but without the heaviness or tannin grip that viognier can display - it remains light on its feet.",
